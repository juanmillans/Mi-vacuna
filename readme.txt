Good morning 

Hope you're having a good time playing with my first complete 
project of a text processor. 

note:
For the sixth function to work properly you have to type 
one of the documents registered on the data folder.  

note #2 :
is also worth noting that the mayority of the data here displayed was created 
using GPT3 chat. and therefore that database is not representative of any group,
asosiation or indiidual of any sort.
